### **Technology Resilience and Recovery (TRR)**

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is responsible for the provisioning and configuration of infrastructure components, ensuring that they adhere to the organization’s security, compliance, and operational standards. However, since each service or solution has its own specific **Technology Resilience and Recovery (TRR) patterns**, it is essential to refer to the respective TRR patterns for each service or solution deployed using IaC.

While IaC ensures automated, consistent provisioning and can integrate high availability and disaster recovery configurations, detailed TRR strategies—such as backup, failover, and recovery mechanisms—are defined and governed by the **specific service’s TRR patterns**. These patterns may include, but are not limited to:

- Multi-region failover strategies
- Disaster recovery (DR) and business continuity plans
- Automated failover and scaling mechanisms
- Backup and recovery processes

Refer to each **service’s TRR documentation** for the specific configurations and processes that ensure resilience and recovery, as IaC is only responsible for implementing those patterns during the infrastructure provisioning phase.
