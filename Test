### **Backups and Ransomware Protection**

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) generally does not manage or store application data directly; its role is to define and provision infrastructure. However, there are specific aspects where backups and ransomware protection are relevant, particularly concerning the **Terraform state file** and the infrastructure IaC provisions.

1. **Terraform State File Backups**:  
   The **Terraform state file** is crucial for tracking the current state of infrastructure. When stored in **AWS S3**, it should be protected to prevent data loss or corruption:
   - Enable **S3 versioning** to maintain a history of the state file and allow recovery in case of accidental deletion or corruption.
   - Ensure **encryption at rest** and **encryption in transit** for securing the state file.
   - Apply **strict IAM access controls** to limit who can view or modify the state file.
   - Enable **S3 Object Lock** with **WORM (Write Once, Read Many)** settings to prevent tampering and protect the state file from ransomware attacks.

2. **Ransomware Protection**:  
   While IaC does not handle application data, it provisions the infrastructure that stores and processes data. IaC can enforce ransomware protection by:
   - Configuring **immutable backups** for services like **RDS**, **EBS volumes**, and **S3 buckets** using features like **S3 Object Lock** or **RDS automated backups** to ensure data cannot be altered.
   - Automating the provisioning of **disaster recovery environments**, allowing for quick recovery from secure backups in case of an attack.
   - Implementing **least-privilege IAM policies** to restrict unauthorized access to critical infrastructure, reducing the risk of exploitation by ransomware.
