Certainly! Here's a revised and extended version:

**Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** tools like **Terraform** and **CloudFormation (CFT)** are invaluable for provisioning cloud infrastructure, automating the creation of resources such as EC2 instances, S3 buckets, VPCs, and more. While these tools are powerful in defining, deploying, and managing infrastructure consistently across environments, they primarily focus on infrastructure provisioning. Once the infrastructure is up and running, these tools may execute basic tasks—such as running initialization scripts during server startup—but they lack the detailed, ongoing control required for deeper system configuration, software management, and application deployment. This gap is where **Configuration Management**, or more broadly, **Configuration as Code (CaC)**, becomes essential. Configuration management tools are designed to handle the ongoing configuration of systems, managing software installations, applying updates, managing security patches, and enforcing system configurations across servers or environments after they have been provisioned. Unlike IaC tools that focus on building infrastructure, CaC tools maintain and manage the state of the systems over time, ensuring consistency, compliance, and operational efficiency, even as changes occur. This distinction makes configuration management a critical complement to IaC, ensuring that not only are the resources provisioned correctly but that they continue to function as expected throughout their lifecycle.
