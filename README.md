### **Mitigation Process for Infrastructure Drift**

Mitigating infrastructure drift involves implementing processes and tools to identify, address, and prevent discrepancies between the actual infrastructure state and the desired state defined in Infrastructure as Code (IaC). The goal is to ensure that any drift is promptly detected and resolved to maintain the security, stability, and consistency of infrastructure.

#### **1. Enforce IaC-Only Changes**

- **IaC as the Source of Truth**: Ensure that all infrastructure changes are made through the IaC pipeline. This means discouraging manual interventions or external modifications to infrastructure that bypass IaC. Any changes to resources should be defined, versioned, and deployed via Terraform, CloudFormation, or other approved IaC tools.
- **Access Control**: Implement **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to limit who can make manual changes directly in cloud environments. This reduces the risk of unauthorized changes causing drift.
- **Approval Gates**: Introduce approval processes in the CI/CD pipeline to ensure all IaC changes are reviewed and verified before being applied. This ensures consistent and predictable infrastructure updates.

#### **2. Regular Drift Detection**

- **Scheduled Drift Checks**: Regularly run drift detection processes to compare the actual infrastructure state against the desired state defined in IaC templates. This can be done daily, weekly, or before major deployments to ensure infrastructure remains in sync.
  - In **Terraform**, use `terraform plan` to detect any changes that have occurred without running the IaC templates.
  - In **CloudFormation**, run **drift detection** on stacks to check for modifications made outside the IaC process.

#### **3. Automated Alerts for Drift Detection**

- **Alerting System**: Configure an alerting system (e.g., **Sumo Logic**, **CloudWatch Alarms**) to notify teams when drift is detected. Alerts should include information about the specific resources affected and the differences between the actual and desired states.
- **Escalation Policy**: Develop an escalation process so that any critical drift, especially security-related changes, is flagged immediately for higher-level investigation and remediation.

#### **4. Collaborative Drift Remediation**

- **Manual Investigation and Resolution**: When drift is detected, responsible teams must investigate the root cause. This includes reviewing logs, identifying the source of the drift (e.g., manual changes, external tools), and determining the best course of action to realign the infrastructure.
- **Apply IaC Fixes**: The remediation process should involve updating the IaC templates to match the desired state and then applying the changes using `terraform apply` or running a **CloudFormation stack update**. This ensures the infrastructure is restored to its compliant, defined state.
- **Track and Document**: Every detected instance of drift and the corresponding resolution must be tracked and documented. This helps identify patterns of drift over time and ensures that improvements can be made to prevent recurrence.

#### **5. Version Control and Documentation**

- **IaC Versioning**: Use version control systems (e.g., **Git**) to ensure all changes to IaC templates are tracked and audited. Each version of the IaC code should be linked to a deployment, allowing teams to trace changes and roll back if necessary.
- **Documentation of Changes**: Maintain detailed documentation of infrastructure changes, whether through IaC or manual interventions. This ensures that any drift can be quickly understood and rectified by reviewing past changes.

### **Drift Detection Strategy**

A well-defined drift detection strategy ensures that infrastructure inconsistencies are identified promptly and resolved before they cause operational, security, or compliance issues. The strategy should encompass both proactive and reactive measures to maintain alignment between the actual infrastructure and the IaC-defined state.

#### **1. Proactive Drift Detection**

- **Pre-Deployment Drift Checks**:
  - Before each deployment, run drift detection processes to ensure that the existing infrastructure state matches the defined IaC templates. This prevents drift from being compounded by new changes and ensures that the infrastructure is in a known state before updates are applied.
  - In Terraform, run `terraform plan` to compare the state file against the actual resources and detect any unmanaged changes.
  - In CloudFormation, use the **drift detection** feature to identify resources that have diverged from the stack template.

- **Regular Scheduled Checks**:
  - Set up a regular cadence (e.g., weekly or monthly) for running drift detection across critical environments such as production, staging, or disaster recovery. Automated scheduled checks ensure that drift is caught early and addressed before it leads to larger issues.
  - These checks should be logged and reviewed by operations and security teams to maintain awareness of any drift events.

#### **2. Continuous Monitoring for Drift**

- **Integrate Drift Detection in CI/CD Pipelines**:
  - Embed drift detection into the CI/CD pipeline as an automatic step before and after deployments. This ensures that teams are aware of any drift before making new infrastructure changes and that post-deployment drift is detected promptly.
  - Tools like **Sumo Logic** can be used to continuously monitor infrastructure changes and log events that might signal drift.

- **Drift Dashboard**:
  - Create a dashboard for visualizing drift detection results. This provides teams with an easy-to-access overview of current drift events, the severity of the detected drift, and whether remediation has been completed. By centralizing all drift information, operations teams can respond more quickly to any discrepancies.

#### **3. Drift Notification and Alerting**

- **Automated Notifications**:
  - When drift is detected, automated notifications should be sent to relevant teams, detailing the resources involved and the nature of the drift. Notifications should include specific details on the resource types (e.g., networking, compute, security), the changes made, and whether those changes are potentially security- or compliance-related.
  
- **Severity-Based Alerts**:
  - Implement a severity-based alerting system. Drift that impacts critical infrastructure, such as security groups, IAM roles, or database configurations, should trigger high-severity alerts and be treated as a priority. Lower-risk drift, such as changes to non-critical resources, can have lower-severity notifications but should still be addressed.

#### **4. Remediation Workflow**

- **Ownership and Accountability**:
  - Assign clear ownership for responding to drift detection alerts. Each alert should be routed to the appropriate teams (e.g., DevOps, security, network operations) depending on the type of drift detected. Establishing accountability ensures that drift is addressed quickly.
  
- **Drift Response Workflow**:
  - Develop a workflow for addressing detected drift. This workflow should include:
    - **Review and Investigation**: Teams must first assess the cause and impact of the drift, including whether it introduces security or operational risks.
    - **Manual or Automated Rollback**: Once the source of the drift is identified, the team can either manually reapply the IaC configurations to correct the drift or initiate an automated rollback, restoring the infrastructure to its desired state.
    - **Post-Remediation Audit**: After drift is corrected, a post-remediation audit should be conducted to confirm that the infrastructure is fully aligned with the IaC-defined state.

By implementing a combination of proactive and reactive drift detection strategies, organizations can prevent infrastructure drift from compromising their operations, security, and compliance. The integration of regular drift checks, continuous monitoring, and clear remediation processes ensures that the infrastructure remains consistent, secure, and reliable over time.
