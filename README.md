We recognize that not all metrics can or should be implemented immediately. Metrics collection will evolve as the infrastructure matures, and teams should prioritize capturing the most critical metrics first. Over time, as the processes and tools mature, additional metrics can be gradually introduced. The goal is to reach comprehensive metrics tracking in a phased approach, ensuring each metric adds value without overwhelming teams from the start. This incremental approach allows for more manageable implementation and refinement over time.
