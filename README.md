Ansible Tower, as a comprehensive solution for configuration management, is detailed in the Ansible Solution Architecture (SA) document. For more information on Ansible Tower and its advanced capabilities, please refer to the dedicated document here: Ansible SA. In this IaC Reference Architecture, the focus is on core aspects of Ansible, such as playbook design, versioning, and best practices, to ensure streamlined and efficient configuration management across environments.




As the logging and monitoring framework for all infrastructure tools (Terraform, CloudFormation, Ansible, Helm, and Checkov) is already integrated with the CI/CD pipeline, it is crucial to refer to the existing CI/CD Reference Architecture (RA) for detailed information on how logs are captured and sent to Sumo Logic. The CI/CD RA outlines how logging and monitoring are centralized to ensure full traceability of infrastructure provisioning, configuration management, and policy enforcement. This IaC RA will focus on the key metrics necessary for assessing the performance and reliability of infrastructure provisioning and management processes.
In addition to the existing logging and monitoring mechanisms, we will outline critical metrics that should be tracked to provide comprehensive insights into deployment efficiency, stability, and compliance across different environments. These metrics will ensure teams can monitor trends, optimize workflows, and address potential issues before they impact the production environment.
Key Metrics to Collect for IaC
1. Deployment Duration
This metric tracks how long it takes for a deployment to complete, from initiation to finish. It helps identify inefficiencies in the provisioning process, such as slow resource creation or cloud API bottlenecks. Monitoring this helps teams optimize deployment times and detect areas that slow down automation workflows.
2. Success-to-Failure Ratio
This measures the ratio of successful infrastructure deployments to failed ones. A higher failure rate may indicate problems such as misconfigured templates, insufficient testing, or API errors. Tracking this metric helps ensure reliability in the deployment process and highlights areas needing improvement.
3. Rollback Rate
The rollback rate tracks how frequently deployments require rollback due to errors, policy violations, or other issues. A high rollback rate suggests instability or poor testing processes. Lower rates reflect a more stable and predictable infrastructure deployment process.
4. Deployment Frequency
This metric tracks how often deployments are triggered over a specific period, broken down by tools like Terraform, CloudFormation, Ansible, and Helm. It provides insights into the agility and activity of infrastructure changes. Frequent, successful deployments indicate a well-functioning CI/CD pipeline.
5. Tool Usage Metrics
Tracks how often different IaC tools are used (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation, Ansible, Helm) for deployments. Understanding which tools are used most often helps optimize workflows and resource allocation. It also highlights areas where tools may be underutilized or need further optimization.
6. Drift Detection Frequency
This metric monitors how often drift detection processes are triggered and how frequently infrastructure drift is identified. High detection rates indicate ongoing manual interventions or external system changes. Monitoring drift helps ensure infrastructure consistency and early detection of issues.
7. Time to Detect and Resolve Issues
Tracks the time it takes to detect and resolve issues like drift or policy violations. Faster detection and resolution times reduce risks related to security, compliance, and operational performance. Monitoring this metric ensures that teams can quickly realign infrastructure to its desired state.
8. Deployment Success Rate by Environment
Monitors the success rate of deployments across different environments such as development, staging, and production. It helps identify discrepancies in environment configurations or deployment workflows. Low success rates in specific environments may indicate configuration issues or resource constraints.
9. Infrastructure Change Rate
Captures how frequently changes are made to the infrastructure, such as adding, updating, or removing resources. A high change rate indicates a dynamic, evolving infrastructure, while a lower rate may signal bottlenecks or slower adoption of new updates. This metric ensures infrastructure changes are made in a controlled, consistent manner.
10. Policy Violation Count
Tracks the number of policy violations detected during IaC deployments, as flagged by tools like Checkov. It highlights areas where security or compliance standards are not being met. Monitoring this metric helps ensure that violations are detected early and remediation is applied quickly.
11. Time to Remediate Policy Violations
Measures the time taken to fix policy violations after they are detected. Faster remediation times reduce the risks posed by non-compliant configurations and help maintain security standards. This metric ensures a strong security posture and rapid response to compliance breaches.
12. Failed Provisioning Attempts by Tool
Monitors how many times infrastructure provisioning attempts fail, categorized by IaC tool (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation, Ansible, Helm). High failure rates can point to inefficiencies in tool configurations or cloud API interactions. This metric helps teams identify the root cause of provisioning issues and apply optimizations.
13. Time to Provision by Resource Type
Tracks the time it takes to provision specific resource types such as compute instances, databases, and networking components. Monitoring this helps identify which resource types consistently delay deployments. It enables teams to optimize resource provisioning processes for faster, more efficient deployments.
14. Change Lead Time (from DORA)
This metric measures the time from code commit to successful deployment. Shorter lead times indicate a highly responsive and efficient pipeline. It tracks overall agility and responsiveness to infrastructure changes and measures how quickly changes can be applied to production environments.
15. Mean Time to Restore (MTTR) (from DORA)
Measures the average time it takes to recover from a failure or deployment issue. MTTR provides insight into the speed and efficiency of incident response and recovery processes. Shorter MTTR helps minimize downtime and service disruptions, ensuring rapid restoration of services.
16. Configuration Drift Count by Resource Type
Tracks the number of drift occurrences categorized by resource types such as compute, networking, or security components. This provides visibility into which types of resources are more prone to drift and need stricter management. It helps prevent manual changes that cause drift.
17. Idle Resource Utilization
Monitors the utilization of underused or idle resources that have been provisioned but are not fully utilized. This metric helps teams identify wasted resources such as idle EC2 instances and optimize or decommission them to reduce costs. Lower idle utilization translates to better resource efficiency.
18. Pipeline Efficiency
Tracks the overall efficiency of the CI/CD pipeline for IaC deployments. It measures how often the pipeline runs into issues like timeouts, bottlenecks, or failed steps. Higher efficiency indicates a streamlined deployment process, while lower efficiency signals the need for pipeline optimization.
19. Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) (from DORA)
Measures the average time between deployment failures, indicating system stability. A longer MTBF suggests more resilient IaC practices and a stable infrastructure. Frequent failures signal the need for improvements in IaC templates, testing processes, or environment configurations.
20. Post-Deployment Testing Time
Captures the time spent running post-deployment tests such as smoke tests, integration tests, and load tests. Tracking this metric helps determine whether post-deployment testing is causing delays or ensuring high-quality deployments. Faster testing without sacrificing quality is the ideal outcome.
21. Failed Resource Deletion Rate
Tracks the number of failed attempts to delete unused or misconfigured resources. High failure rates indicate inefficiencies in resource management or potential cost overhead due to cloud resource sprawl. Proper resource deletion improves infrastructure hygiene and reduces unnecessary costs.
22. Resource Provisioning Error Rate
Monitors the rate of errors that occur during resource provisioning, such as timeouts, resource not found, or misconfigurations. A high error rate suggests that IaC templates or cloud provider configurations need refinement. Lowering this rate leads to more reliable and predictable infrastructure provisioning.
23. Cloud Spend vs. Infrastructure Utilization
Tracks the ratio between cloud spending and actual infrastructure utilization. Monitoring this metric helps optimize cloud spending and prevent over-provisioning. By ensuring resources are fully utilized relative to their cost, teams can maximize cloud efficiency and avoid unnecessary expenses.
24. Code Review and Approval Time for IaC Changes
Measures the average time it takes to review and approve changes to IaC templates before deployment. Ensuring the review process is efficient prevents bottlenecks while maintaining high-quality code standards. Shorter review times enable faster deployment cycles without compromising code quality.
25. Mean Time to First Alert (MTTFA)
Tracks the time between when an infrastructure issue occurs and when the first alert is generated and acknowledged. Shorter MTTFA indicates that the monitoring and alerting system is highly responsive. This metric ensures teams can react quickly to infrastructure incidents before they escalate.


Deployment Patterns for Infrastructure Configuration Management
In addition to the infrastructure provisioning pipeline patterns (Type 1, Type 2, Type 3), this section defines the approved deployment patterns for configuration management using Ansible and Helm. Both tools must be executed exclusively through the approved CI/CD pipelines, ensuring that deployments are secure, auditable, and aligned with organizational standards.
1. Ansible Deployment Pattern
Purpose and Usage:
Ansible is the approved tool for managing configuration changes and ongoing system administration tasks for non-Kubernetes infrastructure. All Ansible playbooks and roles must be version-controlled and executed through the organization’s CI/CD pipeline. This ensures consistency across environments and prevents untracked manual changes.
Execution and Governance:
All Ansible-based configurations, including environment-specific adjustments, system updates, and software deployments, must follow the defined CI/CD workflow. Direct manual execution of Ansible commands on production or staging environments is strictly prohibited to ensure full traceability and compliance with security policies. By using the pipeline, all configuration changes undergo necessary validation and testing before being applied.
Documentation Reference:
For detailed guidelines and implementation steps for integrating Ansible into the CI/CD pipeline, please refer to the Ansible Configuration Management Documentation:

2. Helm Deployment Pattern
Purpose and Usage:
Helm is the approved tool for packaging and managing Kubernetes-based application deployments. All Helm charts and templates must be executed through the organization’s CI/CD pipeline, ensuring that Kubernetes resources are deployed in a consistent and secure manner.
Execution and Governance:
All Helm operations, such as helm install or helm upgrade, must be performed via the approved pipeline. This ensures that every deployment is validated, versioned, and monitored, preventing untracked or manual changes that could compromise the stability or security of the Kubernetes environments. Helm charts should be stored in the central repository (abc-helm), and any updates or customizations should follow the formal review and approval process.
